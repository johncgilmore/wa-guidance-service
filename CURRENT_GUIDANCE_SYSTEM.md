# Current Guidance System - How It Works

## üéØ The Problem You Wanted to Solve

**Question**: "How do I keep WA DOR guidance documents current so users always get the latest information?"

**Answer**: Bundle the guidance IN your npm package + weekly automated reminders to check for updates.

## ‚úÖ What We Built

### 1. **Bundled Guidance Files** 
Guidance documents are now **included in your npm package**. When someone installs `wa-guidance-service`, they get:
- Your expert prompts (how to query AI)
- Your code (API integration, validation)
- **YOUR curated guidance content** (the latest WA DOR documents)

### 2. **Version Tracking System**
`guidance/metadata.json` tracks:
- When you last checked for updates
- When each document was last updated
- Source URLs for each guidance category

### 3. **Automated Reminder System**
GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/check-guidance-updates.yml`) runs **every Monday** and:
- Creates an issue reminding you to check WA DOR website
- Provides direct links to check
- Gives step-by-step instructions for updating

### 4. **Smart Guidance Loader**
New `guidanceLoader.ts` module that:
- Automatically loads bundled guidance
- Allows users to override with their own files (optional)
- Provides metadata about guidance version

## üìä Your Value Proposition Now

### What You Provide to Users:

| Feature | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Expert Prompts** | You've crafted the perfect AI prompts for tax guidance |
| **Current Content** | Users get up-to-date WA DOR guidance automatically |
| **C Street Branding** | Your business info is in every AI response |
| **Ease of Use** | Just `npm install` and go - no file management needed |
| **Trust** | You're the authoritative source for ESSB 5814 guidance |

### What Users Do:

```bash
# Install your package
npm install wa-guidance-service

# Use it (guidance is automatic!)
import { WaGuidanceChatService } from 'wa-guidance-service';

const service = new WaGuidanceChatService({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
});

// That's it! They get current guidance automatically
```

## üîÑ Your Weekly Workflow

### Every Monday (Automated):
1. GitHub creates an issue: "Check for WA DOR guidance updates"

### If Updates Found (Manual - takes 10 minutes):
```bash
# 1. Update the .txt file(s)
# Edit: guidance/wa-guidance/software/guidance.txt

# 2. Update metadata
# Edit: guidance/metadata.json (change date/version)

# 3. Test
npm run build && npm test

# 4. Bump version and publish
npm version patch
npm publish

# 5. Done! All users get updates on next `npm update`
```

### If No Updates:
1. Close the GitHub issue
2. Add comment: "Checked - no updates"
3. Done!

## üí° The 80/20 Explanation

**The Big Idea**: 
You're not just providing code - you're providing **maintained, expert-curated content**. This is like:
- A newspaper subscription (they curate the news)
- A meal kit service (they pick the recipes)
- Spotify (they curate the music libraries)

**Your Role**:
You're the "curator" of ESSB 5814 guidance. Users trust YOU to:
1. Monitor WA DOR for changes
2. Extract and format the guidance correctly
3. Update the package when things change
4. Maintain the AI prompts that make sense of it all

**The Business Model**:
- Free package (builds trust, gets users)
- Your business name in every response (marketing!)
- Users who need help ‚Üí become C Street Tax clients

## üìÅ What Got Created

New files:
- `src/guidanceLoader.ts` - Loads guidance (bundled or custom)
- `guidance/metadata.json` - Tracks versions and dates
- `guidance/wa-guidance/**/guidance.txt` - 12 guidance files (placeholders for now)
- `.github/workflows/check-guidance-updates.yml` - Weekly reminder automation
- `UPDATING_GUIDANCE.md` - Instructions for updating guidance
- `guidance/README.md` - Info about the guidance directory

Updated files:
- `package.json` - Now includes `guidance` directory in published files
- `src/chat.ts` - Uses new guidanceLoader
- `src/index.ts` - Exports guidance functions
- `README.md` - Documents bundled guidance feature

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Add Real Guidance Content**: Replace the placeholder .txt files with actual WA DOR guidance
2. **Test It**: Build and verify everything works
3. **Publish**: `npm version minor` (it's a new feature!) and `npm publish`
4. **Market It**: "Always current WA ESSB 5814 guidance - maintained by C Street Tax"
